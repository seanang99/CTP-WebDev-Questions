# Create your own Profile page
This week, we will learn html and css, and create our very own Profile / About-me page.

## Basic Structure of HTML page
Each html file will have `<!DOCTYPE html>` tag with a `<head>` and `<body>` tag. 
- `<head>` tag contains metadata, page title, links to stylesheet or other web programmes (e.g. Google Tag Manager...)
- `<body>` tag contains the main elements of the html file that will be displayed on the webpage

Let's start building our profile page. We'll code from top-down.

First, let's create a header and masthead. We'll include a profile picture and background picture.
- My theme is yellow and blue, but you're free to choose a colour palette that you fancy.

Next, we can create some sections to introduce ourselves and where we are from. You may think of other things you want to share - they can be new sections. 

## Add in CSS
Let's style the page. We'll style each section at a time. 

- Align everything to the center
- Provide some margins
- 

## Add more sections in "More About Me"
Next add more sections to share about yourself. 
Here are some prompts:
- What are your favourite hobbies?
- What's your dream job?
- Why do you want to become a web developer?
- ...

## Add a Connect section
Next, let's create a connect section that allows visitors to write messages to us. 
 
## Enabling MAILTO
You may need to enable the MAILTO protocol. 

If you're using chrome to run your live server, follow these steps:
1. Go to `chrome://settings/handlers`
2. Check if there are any default handlers. If there are none, go to gmail.com
3. You should see a prompt beside the bookmark button which will ask you to "Allow Gmail (mail.google.com) to open all email links" -> select "Use Gmail" option
3a. This will allow us to utilise the gmail email client.
4. You may disable this after the project by deleting the protocol.

## Footer
Lastly, let's create a footer with links to some of our social media accounts.

# Homework (Bonus)
Here are some possible projects that you would like to do:
1. Create a page that uses parallex scrolling
- Parallex scroling is a web trend where the background content (i.e. image) is moved at a different speed than the foreground content while scrolling.
