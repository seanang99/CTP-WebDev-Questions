# Create your own Profile page
This week, we will learn html and css, and create our very own Profile / About-me page.

## Prerequisites

You may need to enable the MAILTO protocol for this to work. 

If you're using chrome to run your live server, follow these steps:
1. Go to `chrome://settings/handlers`
2. Check if there are any default handlers. If there are none, go to gmail.com
3. You should see a prompt beside the bookmark button which will ask you to "Allow Gmail (mail.google.com) to open all email links" -> select "Use Gmail" option
3a. This will allow us to utilise the gmail email client.
4. You may disable this after the project by deleting the protocol.
