    <h1>Introduction</h1>
    <p>I am a final year student studying information systems and business. I think I like technology and enjoy
      learning new things. But I know that I love God and his creations.</p>

  <section class="section-location">
    <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
    <p>I'm a local from Singapore and live in the south-eastern part the country. It's a sleepy neighbourhood called
      "Pek Kio" which translates to white bridge in a chinese dialect. There is a white bridge in my neigbourhood but
      its not very impressive.</p>

    <h1>More About Me</h1>
    <h2>What are your favourite hobbies?</h2>
    <p>I enjoy drawing, cooking and watching movies. I also like to learn new things in my free time. In the recent
      summer, I learnt embroidery and beading. I also learned how to create simple animations with Canvas JS.</p>

    <h2>What's your dream job?</h2>
    <p>
      My dream job is at the crossroads between technology and fashion. I dream to become a technologists/consultant who
      is able to digitalise fashion businesses and improve the way we create and consume fashion.</p>

    <h2>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h2>
    <p>
      Because I get to create new things that are used by people everywhere! And there seems to be great job prospects
      :)
